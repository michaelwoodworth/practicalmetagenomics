# 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis

Week 10 goals are to understand the tools and steps involved in analyzing 16S rRNA gene amplicons.

There are several analytic suites for 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis. QIIME2 and [mothur](https://mothur.org) are two of the most commonly used. We will focus primarily on QIIME2.

## QIIME2

As a mature analytic pipeline, QIIME2 has several sample datasets, robust installation and usage documentation, as well as an active user base for support to resolve issues.

### Install QIIME2

Installation [instructions for QIIME2 can be found here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/install/).

### Complete the moving pictures tutorial

The [moving pictures tutorial can be found here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/moving-pictures/).

### [OPTIONAL] Complete the FMT tutorial

The QIIME2 [FMT tutorial can be found here](https://docs.qiime2.org/2023.2/tutorials/fmt/).

## Week 11 prep (5 minutes)

Next week, we will tentatively plan to continue work in QIIME2.
