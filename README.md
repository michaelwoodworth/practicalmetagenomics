# Practical Metagenomics
The primary motivation for this repository to document reading outlines, resources, and questions as an introduction to practical analysis of metagenomes.

At each step in analysis, we post the tools, their citation (when available), and annotated code used with (in most cases) the expected input and output for metagenomic data. We use the genomic and metagenomic analyses from the paper **Randomized trial: Fecal microbiota transplant promotes reduction of antimicrobial resistance by strain replacement** as a practical example. 

Data for the analyses in the PREMIX paper that will be used for this repository are available through the NCBI Bioproject (accession PRJNA728680).
